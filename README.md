Binomial Probability Calculator

This Python script allows you to calculate binomial probabilities using the cumulative probability distribution (CDF) and the probability mass function (PMF). It provides options to calculate probabilities of at most, at least, and exactly a specified number of successes in a sample.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- **Probability of at most k**: `P(X â‰¤ k)`
- **Probability of at least k**: `P(X â‰¥ k)`
- **Probability of exactly k**: `P(X = k)`
- Option to reset population and success probability values.

## ðŸ“¥ Requirements

Before running the script, make sure you have the `scipy` library installed. If necessary, install it with:

```sh
pip install scipy
